<objective>
Generate 7 Gemini images for the game: title screen, 5 room backgrounds, and ending scene. These are the highest-impact visual assets -- every player sees backgrounds 100% of the time.

Purpose: Create the core visual foundation for the game. Backgrounds define the atmosphere of every scene.
Output: 7 PNG images in the images/ folder, ready for integration in Plan 04-02.

**Art budget rationale:** 7 of 10 max images. User wants fewer images with maximum impact. Room backgrounds and title/ending are seen by every player throughout the entire game. Character portraits are kept as SVG (80x80px in a dialogue box -- Gemini images would look worse at that scale). This gives the best visual bang for the budget.

  <name>Task 1: Generate 7 Gemini images for game backgrounds and key scenes</name>
  <files>images/</files>
  <action>
Create the images/ directory if it doesn't exist:
```
mkdir -p images
```

Use the `gemini-image-gen` skill to generate each image. The game is "Dead End Job" -- a point-and-click adventure set in the Afterlife Processing Department, a soul-crushingly mundane government office where the dead get their paperwork sorted. Think DMV meets purgatory. The aesthetic is: fluorescent-lit, drab, bureaucratic, slightly surreal, darkly humorous.

Generate these 7 images one at a time, saving each to the images/ folder:

**1. Title Screen** (save as `images/title-screen.png`)
Prompt: "A dark, moody establishing shot of a decrepit government office building at night, glowing with sickly fluorescent light from the windows. A crooked sign reads 'AFTERLIFE PROCESSING DEPT.' The sky is an ethereal deep purple-indigo void with no stars. Painterly digital art style, atmospheric, slightly surreal, muted colors with pops of eerie green fluorescent glow. Landscape orientation, suitable as a game title screen background."

**2. Waiting Room** (save as `images/waiting-room.png`)
Prompt: "Interior of a dingy government waiting room in a supernatural afterlife office. Rows of plastic chairs bolted to the floor, harsh fluorescent tube lighting casting sickly green-white light, a broken take-a-number machine on the wall, motivational posters with curling edges, a water cooler, scuffed linoleum floor. The room feels endless and timeless. Painterly digital art style, muted greens and grays, institutional dread atmosphere. Landscape orientation, point-and-click adventure game background."

**3. Front Desk** (save as `images/front-desk.png`)
Prompt: "Interior of a bureaucratic front desk counter in a supernatural afterlife processing office. A long wooden counter with a glass partition, mountains of paperwork stacked everywhere, a dusty 'NEXT' number sign, a small service bell, harsh overhead fluorescent lighting. Behind the counter are filing shelves and doors leading to other departments. Warm amber-brown tones mixed with cold fluorescent light. Painterly digital art style, detailed, atmospheric. Landscape orientation, point-and-click adventure game background."

**4. Break Room** (save as `images/break-room.png`)
Prompt: "Interior of a sad, sterile office break room in a supernatural afterlife department. A coffee machine with a cryptic display, a vending machine with something stuck behind the glass, a break table covered in coffee ring stains, a Lost and Found box in the corner, cheap plastic chairs. Cool blue-gray lighting with warm coffee-brown accents. Everything looks decades old but timeless. Painterly digital art style, melancholy but slightly humorous atmosphere. Landscape orientation, point-and-click adventure game background."

**5. Filing Room** (save as `images/filing-room.png`)
Prompt: "Interior of a massive, cramped filing room in a supernatural afterlife office. Floor-to-ceiling filing cabinets stretching into shadowy depths, one large filing cabinet in the center that looks slightly anthropomorphic and important. Dusty air, dim overhead lighting, papers scattered on the floor, narrow aisles between cabinets. Beige and dark brown tones with dusty atmospheric haze. Painterly digital art style, claustrophobic, mysterious. Landscape orientation, point-and-click adventure game background."

**6. Manager's Office** (save as `images/manager-office.png`)
Prompt: "Interior of an overly cheerful manager's office in a supernatural afterlife department, contrasting with the drab building. A large wooden desk with motivational tchotchkes and a '#1 Boss' mug, a motivational plaque on the wall, a fake potted plant, warm lighting from a desk lamp. The room is nicer than the rest of the office but in an unsettling, too-perfect way. Rich burgundy and dark wood tones with warm golden lighting. Painterly digital art style, point-and-click adventure game background. Landscape orientation."

**7. Ending Scene** (save as `images/ending-scene.png`)
Prompt: "A soul stepping through a glowing golden doorway, leaving behind a dark bureaucratic office. The doorway radiates warm golden-white light that floods the scene. The figure is silhouetted, walking forward into the light. Behind them, the drab fluorescent office fades into shadow. A feeling of relief, transcendence, and moving on. Painterly digital art style, dramatic lighting contrast between warm gold and cold institutional gray. Landscape orientation, suitable as a game ending screen background."

For each image, invoke the `gemini-image-gen` skill with the prompt and desired filename. Wait for each generation to complete before proceeding to the next.

  <what-built>7 Gemini-generated game background images</what-built>
  <how-to-verify>
    1. Open each image in the images/ folder and verify:
       - title-screen.png: Dark, moody afterlife office exterior suitable for title screen
       - waiting-room.png: Dingy government waiting room with fluorescent lighting
       - front-desk.png: Bureaucratic counter with paperwork and glass partition
       - break-room.png: Sterile break room with coffee machine and vending machine
       - filing-room.png: Cramped room full of filing cabinets
       - manager-office.png: Overly cheerful manager's office with warm tones
       - ending-scene.png: Golden doorway with silhouetted figure, transcendence theme
    2. Each image should look like a painterly point-and-click adventure game background
    3. Images should have landscape orientation suitable for full-screen display
